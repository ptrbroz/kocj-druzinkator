\section{Intro (What even is this?)}

Družinkátor is a tool for finding optimal placement of the Czech language olympiad summer camp (TOČJ from now on) attendees into companies.
This is achieved by solving a mixed integer program (MIP) with PySCIPOpt\footnote{https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt}.

For now, the purpose of this file is mainly to describe the formulation of this MIP, not to provide documentation of Družinkátor's functions, since the 
author (foolishly) believes the comments within the code to be sufficient.

\section{Problem statement}

Each attendee of TOČJ must be placed into exactly one of four companies.  This assignment is fixed for the whole duration of the camp.  Not all attendees are
present for the full duration -- they might for example only partake in the first or second week of the camp. \\

Three main objectives are pursued when deciding the placement of people:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \textbf{Respecting incompatibilities:}\\
    Some people should not be placed together in the same company, e.g. siblings or romantically involved couples.

    \item
    \textbf{Balancing companies:}\\
    The companies should be balanced in their manpowers, so as to make competition between the companies more practical.  It is also desirable to spread
    other characteristics or skills evenly between the companies -- e.g., if 4 students of Matfyz attend the camp, it is better to spread them 1-1-1-1 than
    to jam them all into one company\footnote{
    This balancing act should be viewed on a day by day basis, taking into account the different attendances of individual people.  If we want balanced
    competition on monday, then the companies should be balanced on monday, etc.}.

    \item
    \textbf{Interannual mixing:}\\
    For veterans attending for multiple years, an attempt should be made to vary whom they share companies with.  E.g., if person A and person B were placed 
    in the same company last year and the year before that, we should try not to place them in the same company this year.
\end{itemize}


\section{Mixed integer program formulation}

SCIPopt expects a MIP formulated as

\begin{equation}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
\underset{\mathbf{x}}{\text{min}} \quad & f(\mathbf{x})  \\ 
\text{s.t.} \quad & g_i(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0  &&\forall i \in I\\
& l_j \leq x_j \leq u_j \quad &&\forall j \in J \\
& x_k \in \mathbb{Z} &&\forall k \in K
\end{alignedat}
\tag{MIP formulation}
\label{MIP}
\end{equation}

where $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g_i(\mathbf{x})$ are (nonlinear) functions of the vector of all optimization variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $J,K$ are subsets of 
the set containing all indices of $\mathbf{x}$.  

\subsection{Membersip variables}

Let's begin by modelling the assignment of people into companies.  The \emph{membership} optimization variables, arranged 
into the membership matrix $M$, take care of that.

$M$ is a $4\times{}p$ matrix where $p$ is the total number of people attending TOČJ.  Each column then represents one person.  Membership variable $M_{i,j}$
represents the truth value of the statement "Person $j$ is assigned to company $i$."  For example, if $M$ took the following form:

\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\]

\noindent then that would represent the situation where person 0 is placed in company 0, persons 1 and 2 are placed in company 3 and the rest in company 2, with
company 1 having no members.

To ensure that each person is placed into exactly one company, following constraints are placed on the variables:

\begin{alignat}{2}
    &M_{i,j} \in \mathbb{Z} \quad \quad &&\forall i, j. \label{integerReq} \\
    0 \leq &M_{i,j} \leq 1 &&\forall i, j. \\
    \mathbb{1}^{T} \cdot &M = \mathbb{1}^{T},
\end{alignat}

where $\mathbb{1}_n$ is a column vector of ones.

The $M_{i,j}$ variables are the crucial ones -- although more optimization variables are introduced later, the solution of the optimization problem is 
fully captured in the values of $M_{i,j}$.  

Note that constraint \ref{integerReq} is what turns this problem from what would otherwise be a tame quadratic program into a MIP.

\subsection{Cost function}

The function $f$ from \ref{MIP}, which will be minimized by the solver, consists of 3 terms:

\begin{equation}
    f = AAE_{sum} + CCP_{sum} + SP_{sum}.
\end{equation}

How the terms come about will be elaborated later.  $AAE$ stands for Absolute Attribute Error -- this term penalizes imbalance between the companies.  $CCP$
stands for Co-Company Penalty, and the second term penalizes lack of interannual mixing.  $SP$ stands for Soft Penalty and the last term penalises violations
of soft constraints.

\subsection{Shared Company Matrix}
\label{SCM}
To aid in formulating further parts of the problem, I introduce the Shared Company Matrix, or $SCM$ for short.  $SCM$ is a $p\times{}p$ matrix, where 
$SCM_{i,j}$ is equal to 1 if persons $i$ and $j$ are placed in the same company and 0 if they are not.  This is achieved by setting

\begin{equation}
    SCM_{i,j} = \mathbb{1}^{T} \cdot 
    (
        \begin{pmatrix}
        M_{0,i} \\
        M_{1,i} \\
        M_{2,i} \\
        M_{3,i} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\odot
    \begin{pmatrix}
    M_{0,j} \\
    M_{1,j} \\
    M_{2,j} \\
    M_{3,j} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    ),
\end{equation}

where $\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication.

\subsection{Handling incompatibilities}

Introducing a constraint in the form $SCM_{i,j} = 0$ ensures that $i$th and $j$th person will not be placed together in the same company.  Setting the right
side to 1 would instead require that they be placed in the same company.

Alternatively, those limitations can be formulated as soft constraints -- in that case, the penalty for violating such soft constraint is addded to $SP_{sum}$.



\subsection{Balancing companies}

Now comes the meat of the optimization problem, so to speak.  Each person is endowed with certain attributes.  Many different traits can be modeled by
assigning attributes to people: being a person (modelled by the "human" attribute automatically assigned to everyone), having a mathematical education (the 
"matfyz" attribute), H-index, profficiency in piloting hot air ballons...  Attributes (apart from "human") are not hardcoded in Družinkátor, rather,
they are assigned as part of the problem definition for a specific year.  Attributes are assumed to be non-negative\footnote{This describes the assumption I 
held while writing the program.  I'm not certain that negative attribute values would actually break anything -- but I definitely didn't consider them, so
if you do introduce them, you'll be doing so at your own peril.}, but they need not take integer values -- you could have a "half-matfyz", for example.

Persons contribute all of their attributes to the company they are assigned to, but only on days on which they are present.  The goal of
balancing companies with respect to a given attribute is understood as the following problem:

\begin{equation}
\text{min} \quad  \sum_{d=0}^{13} \sum_{i=0}^3 w_{attr}(d)\cdot{}\left|(\sum_{p\in{C_i}}p.attr\cdot{}p.pres(d)) - \frac{1}{4}(\sum_{p\in{}P} p.attr\cdot{}p.pres(d))\right|,
\label{eq:min_AAE_simple}
\end{equation}

where $d$ is the day index, $i$ is the company index, $w_{attr}(d)$ is a daily attribute optimization weigh, $C_i$ is the set of all persons placed in company $i$,
$P$ is the set of all persons, $p.attr$ is the value of the given attribute possessed by person $p$ and $p.pres(d)$ is 1 if person $p$ is present on
day $d$, 0 otherwise.

In other words -- ideally, I want each company to have exactly one fourth of the total value of given attribute on each day.  Equation \ref{eq:min_AAE_simple} only
deals with a single attribute -- and so will the rest of this section, as balancing for multiple attributes is done by simply repeating the steps that will
be described for each of them.
